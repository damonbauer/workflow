      * ask yourself this question: what can your team, including design & product, agree on that is the smallest piece of work?
      * Once you have that, ensure these 3 things are true with that smallest piece of work.

      * Now that we have an understanding about _what_ we're trying to build, let's talk about building it.
      * Pull Requests _should be_ the manifestation of all the planning your team has _already_ done & agreed to before touching code.

    share context
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: before code</div>

    <notes>
      * Think of just some of the reasons why you might be out of the office or even away from your desk. Sick time, vacation, DMV, meetings (this one included)... there are plenty of times where a teammate could pick up where you left off. This is why planning the work with your team is crucial. Everyone should have a decent understanding of what we're building and a pretty solidified idea on how.

    avoid costly mistakes
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: before code</div>

    <notes>
      * If you make one big PR that has a concept baked in that is "wrong", it's very difficult to change.
      * However, in the scenarios I'm proposing, your team has agreed on how to build something and everyone has the context of what we're building. Also, you'll be making very small PRs. These 3 pieces make it trivial for a teammate to call out a "wrong" concept & it's also easy for you to fix it before it is proliferated throughout the code.

      INTRO:
      Hi, I'm Damon Bauer. I'm a developer on the Gazelle Debit Card team. I've been at Ramsey Solutions for 5 1/2 years. I started working on daveramsey.com, then moved to EveryDollar where I worked on the browser app for about 3 years.

      This is a talk about how I do work. Most of these ideas are not mine, but I've learned them over my time here.

      There's a good chance you've heard of, or even practice, a lot of what I'm going to talk about. My hope is that everyone can find at least _something_ to try and improve our code, processes and end products.

      One thing you'll probably notice as I speak is that this talk has almost nothing to do with the actual code you write. This talk has much more to do with how you communicate, think about problems, and find solutions that serve your team, the business, and ultimately the users of your code.

      How do we break this work down?

  <div>
    <em>ruthlessly</em> cut scope
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design</div>

    <notes>
      * Alongside designers and product managers, ask these questions:
        * what can we agree on that is the smallest piece of work?
        * what can we _not_ ship?
        * what can we get away with _not_ doing?
      * Designers push the boundaries of our UI's. They challenge our assumptions, they question why something is technically not possible. This is a good thing! This is your chance to challege them! It's not a fight or a power struggle; it's an exercise in give and take and learning what's imperative to keep vs. what's a "nice to have".
      * Once you've cut scope, ensure these 3 things are true with that smallest piece of work.

  <div>
    provide <em>some</em> user value
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: ruthlessly cut scope</div>

    <notes>
      The most important thing to ensure is that this new piece of work still provides user value.

      If the user can still perform the task they need, you're on the right track. Now it becomes a discussion with the rest of your team to ensure what will be delivered is an acceptable first iteration.

    <notes>
      Here are 2 screenshots from a "transfer funds" feature we built. The goal was to enable a user to transfer funds from a connected bank account into their Gazelle account. On the left was the mockup, on the right was what we delivered as a _3rd_ iteration.

      Things we cut included: bank icons, custom select box, account balances & numbers, to/from toggle, scheduling the transfer, withdraw & deposit estimates.

      This was around 4 months ago... and we're still using what's on the right. We'll eventually get to improving it, but we're solving more important problems right now.

  <div>
    don't box yourself in
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: ruthlessly cut scope</div>
    <notes>
      The small piece of work should help build a foundation to help you iterate quickly.

      For example, our very first iteration of this feature was a page that had a single button of "Transfer $25". That's it. You could transfer $25 into Gazelle.

      This didn't box us in because we were able to build all the code behind the scenes to accept an account to transfer from, an account to transfer to, and an amount. We were able to both ship _something_ and build the back end functionality we'd need no matter what the interface is.

      That leads me to the last point - ship quickly & learn.

  <div>
    ship quickly & learn
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: ruthlessly cut scope</div>
    <notes>
      The point of this exercise is to ship as fast as you can, so you can begin learning how real people interact with your product in real environments.

      This isn't limited to just "did a user like this feature" either.
      For instance... the number of times I've been bitten by a CloudFront configuration not forwarding query parameters, or not accepting cookies... is embarrasing.
      However, if we ship something out to production quickly, we are able to find those things that much faster. In this sort of problem, having shipped small pieces rules out a lot of "potential" problems, so it's easier to find that my cookies aren't being whitelisted.

    before code
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design</div>

    <notes>
      Now that we have an understanding about how we're trying to go about building things, let's talk about actually building it. Before we even write the code, though, we can flex our software "design" muscle. That's what we'll focus on for the next few minutes.
      
      Let me say this from the top: Pull Requests _should be_ the manifestation of all the planning your team has gone through & agreed to _before_ touching code.

      Let's talk about why.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    get feedback early
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: before code</div>

    <notes>
      When we pair or even group up, you're able to use the team as a sounding board to discuss ideas, tradeoffs and work through logic decisions.

      We have a saying here, "If you want to go fast, work alone. If you want to go far, work together." This is never more true than applying it to this idea. When I plan how to solve a problems _together_, I inevitably end up with a better solution. We're able to bounce ideas off one another, think of different edge cases and talk through different patterns.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    share context
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: before code</div>

    <notes>
      This idea piggybacks off the last. If we're working as a group to solve a problem, we all get context and learn a little more about how our systems work.

      Think of just some of the reasons why you might be out of the office or even away from your desk. Sick time, vacation, DMV, meetings (this one included)... there are plenty of times where a teammate could pick up where you left off. This is why planning the work with your team is crucial. Everyone should have a decent understanding of what we're building and a pretty solidified idea on how.

  <div>
    avoid costly mistakes
    <div class="part-marker">part 1: design: before code</div>

    <notes>
      If I make one big PR and I'm the only one with the context of how and why it works, and that PR has some concept baked in that is "wrong", it's very difficult to change, especially if it's all throughout the PR.

      However, in the scenarios I'm proposing, your team has agreed on how to build something and we should all have the context of what we're building. Also, you'll be making very small PRs. These 3 facts make it trivial for a teammate to call out a "wrong" concept early on in the process so it's easier for you to fix it before it is proliferated throughout the code.

    artifacts

    <notes>
      OK, so we've got an idea of _how_ we want to work, and we know _why_ it's valuable. How do we _actually_ do this?

      The big outcome of this "pre-work" are design artifacts.

      One of the clearest, most succinct ways I've found to communicate our intentions as developers is to create an is/is not table.

    <notes>
      Here's an example. These tables are intended to provide a high level overview about the scope upcoming work.
      
      It helps the author decide what to include - and just as important - what to exclude, by focusing attention by providing distinct boundaries.

    <div class="part-marker">part 2: always be shipping: how</div>

    <notes>
      Tickets should be written so as they move across the board, user value is being delivered. On Gazelle, we make a parent ticket that describes the feature that has all the acceptance criteria, testing notes & user stories. Then, we make sub tasks that we'll use to track our work. So the parent ticket acts almost as an "epic".

      It's common for a ticket to have 10-15, sometimes 20, subtasks if it's a brand new feature.
